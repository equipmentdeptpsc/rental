# UAT backlog

| Item | State | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Catalog 2.0 Users-list visibility | CLOSED | 00700 applied; four users and both Operations Managers visible with role embeds. |
| Duplicate Operations Manager | CLOSED | `645384d0-c872-4245-84b5-9ec16305431c` deactivated; original and both Auth identities preserved. |
| Rental Activate | CLOSED | RNT-2026-000001 activated; DEUR/commercial/Assignment/equipment invariants preserved. |
| Canonical remote Return | VERIFIED | Existing canonical `returnAll` command wired into remote quick actions; deployed control is visible and enabled. Return was not executed. |
| Remote Audit Trail projection | OPEN | UI shows zero events despite successful transactional trusted commands; diagnose after Return deployment. |
| Digital DEUR end-to-end | VERIFIED | DEUR-2026-000001 corrected audibly to `2026-08-26`, exercised through activity transitions, completed, and submitted exactly once. |
| Grouped customer acknowledgement | VERIFIED | One trusted grouped review was delivered through the isolated-UAT override and manually acknowledged; the canonical DEUR is Acknowledged at row version 9 with one consumed request and no duplicate outcome. |
| Post-acknowledgement workspace projection | VERIFIED | Commit `1059949` deployed as UAT Worker `45874c26-0d88-4fc8-9354-686168e832f2`; canonical Equipment and Acknowledged DEUR now project into the workspace and Billing readiness. |
| Missing 2026-08-25 DEUR expectation | VERIFIED | Forward-only `20260827000100` corrected the invalid DEUR guard. One approved waiver now persists for 2026-08-25 with exact reason; Expected 3, Acknowledged 1, Waived 1, Missing 0 after hard refresh, with no fabricated DEUR. |
| Billing Preview optional-term normalization | VERIFIED | Deployed Worker `7886816e-cc1c-42cc-8866-1efad7386752` projects the authorized immutable snapshot and omits only null optional values. Hard refresh shows Final Preview PHP 3,883.33; zero billing statements/invoices and no financial mutation. |
| Canonical remote Billing creation | VERIFIED | Exactly one Draft `BS-2026-000001` persists for 2026-08-26 with one line and PHP 3,883.33 subtotal; Not Invoiced. Remote joined projection and fail-closed action UI deployed in `e4eaeb7`/`5668d47`. |
| UAT DEFECT INVESTIGATION — Rental Equipment Line / DEUR Relationship | P1 YELLOW | Core line/DEUR/revision/cardinality is canonical. Still certify remote FK validation state, five underlying UUIDs/audit IDs, composite Operator/provenance gaps, Audit Trail, and multi-equipment behavior across every remote projection. |
| Immutable Billing lineage | VERIFIED | Commit `64e1889`; forward-only `20260828000100` applied; Worker `ce0b581a-3069-4adf-86cb-ab03ddbd877f` deployed. Clean replay and rollback-only multi-equipment/adversarial database certification pass; existing statement remains Draft/Not Invoiced at PHP 3,883.33. |
| Canonical Return expectation gate | VERIFIED | Commit `bc255f6`, migration `20260828000200`, Worker `07def546-d069-4839-ba96-f3dcb13a2b2b`; remote Return is disabled while 2026-08-27 is unresolved. No Return was executed. |
| Canonical Per Hour precision | VERIFIED | `20260827000200` applied only to isolated UAT; exact-minute pricing produced the certified PHP 3,883.33 statement without changing displayed 3.8833 hours. |
| Daily Operations remote logs projection | REMEDIATION READY | Remote mapper now guarantees `logs: []` when the compatibility collection is absent while preserving canonical events and any existing logs. Deployment and browser route/deep-link certification remain. |
| Remote Operator commercial evidence | CLOSED | Operators remain unable to read financial snapshots; remote preparation now delegates immutable commercial binding to the canonical server command. |
| Remote DEUR event projection | CLOSED | `deur_events` are hydrated and ordered; the active view now shows Operation instead of offering a duplicate Start Operation. |
| UX/UI modernization | OPEN | Begin with Rental Workspace only after its workflow is green. |
| Configurable DEUR shift metadata | OPEN | System Administrator configuration for enabled/disabled state, label, allowed descriptive values, display order, and active state. Shift remains optional metadata and never changes daily DEUR, expectation, customer-review, or billing identity. |
| Authorized Operator turnover / reliever continuation | P1 DESIGN REQUIRED | One daily Equipment-line DEUR must retain its identity while authenticated relievers append actor-attributed turnover/continuation events. Current ownership checks admit only the assigned Operator; design an explicit accept/continue state transition without overwriting prior participation. |
| eDEUR Mobile canonical integration | P1B LOCAL GREEN | Isolated-UAT configuration and canonical operational UX are locally certified. Deploy and perform non-mutating runtime checks before the separately authorized real Operator DEUR milestone. |
| eDEUR Mobile canonical authentication | P1 REMEDIATION READY | Live isolated-UAT Worker preflight rejects Expo Web localhost with 405/no CORS. Local Worker and Mobile fixes are tested; obtain the separately required Worker deployment approval, then restart Expo and perform a human credential retry. |
| Configurable DEUR activity reasons | OPEN | Allow System Administrators to manage enabled reasons, labels, sort order, applicability to Idle/Standby, active state, and whether a reason is required. |
| Limited Operational Pilot envelope | DEFINED | `uat/LIMITED-OPERATIONAL-PILOT-PLAN.md` defines a five-day, one-site/two-Rental/three-equipment envelope; offline, turnover, external email, billing, Return, and support gaps remain blockers. |
